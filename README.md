# k-means Clustering with R

Appropriate for users familiar with R, this hour long interactive, virtual workshop will explore unsupervised machine learning with [kmeans](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/kmeans) clustering. Cluster analysis finds the natural groupings of data based on one or more measurements. As an unsupervised machine learning method, these algorithms have no dependent variable. The workshop will focus on k-means clustering and how to choose the optimal number of clusters.
